# Change-Brake-Pads is an app written in C#. The purpose of the app is to help the user change their own brake pads instead of spending money getting it done in a garage. I came up with the idea after I fitted my own and a friend said it would be very handy if he knew how to do little things like this to save money. So i decided that my app should be an info app on how to change your own brake pads. Thanks for downloading :)
