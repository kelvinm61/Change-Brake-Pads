# Change-Brake-Pads is an app written in C#. I wrote this app for a college project and the purpose of the app is to help the user change their own brkae pads instead of speding money getting it done in a garage. I came up with the idea after I fitted my own and a friend said it would be very handy if he knew how to do things like this to save money. So i decided that my app should be an info app on how to change your own brake pads.
